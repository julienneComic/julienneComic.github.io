  "description": "ANNOUNCEMENT! This is the last update for 2024. I'm taking the whole month of January off work and general existing on the internet for a sorely overdue recharge, during which I plan to give myself over body and soul to granny hobbies. In the meantime, I'm scheduling some extras over on Patreon (patreon.com/snutter) across all tiers to go up in January. The comic will resume Friday, February 8th! I hope you all have a lovely holiday season. Thank you so much for your kind and enthusiastic support. I love getting to make this comic for you all. See you in 2025!",
