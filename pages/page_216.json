  "description": "Hey folks, I'm very sorry for the short notice, but I need to put the comic on hiatus for a bit. Nothing too serious, but working on new pages has been triggering some unmanageable anxiety lately, and I'm needing to take a step back to regroup. Writing prose excerpts and compiling behind-the-scenes content has been easier for me, so I'm still posting extras over on Patreon, and will hopefully be able to resume making pages soon. Subscribe to the email list or keep an eye on my socials for updates and return announcements. Thank you for reading, and for bearing with me! I appreciate you all so much. <3",
